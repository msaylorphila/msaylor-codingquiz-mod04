# msaylor-codingquiz-mod04

## Description

In this module we designed a quiz using web APIs in javascript. With the knowledge we gained in module 4 I was able to develop a quiz that upon starting had a timer, a fresh new question upon answering, a saved score upon reload, and the ability to restart the quiz. See below a screenshot demonstrating the small amount of code used in the HTML file as this project was mainly made in JavaScript.
